		<h3>How to Combat Disinformation</h3>
		<p>Finding solutions to combat disinformation has been an issue for several years and many experts believe there is no concrete way to do so. Instead, people have come up with certain ideas and have created their own adblockers and misinformation detectors. A common method of disinformation is through advertisements and falsely portraying the views of influencers and politicians to attract more customers and reach a wider audience. Adblockers help combat this by completely blocking any way of these advertisements reaching you. Another method to combat these types of advertisements is to contact the people being used in the advertisement. There are certain times where poets are authors are seen in these advertisements and their audience recognizes that this is out of character or doesn't seem right, knowing this, many people email these authors about the advertisement and it is then legally settled through them. </p>

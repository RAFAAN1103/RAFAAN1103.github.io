		<h3>What is Disinformation</h3>
		<p>Disinformation is false information that is spread with the intent of of misleading, decieving, or manipulating an audience. An example of this would be propoganda issued by a government organization to a rival power or the media. Disinformation comes in several forms. Fabricated content is false information, manipulated content includes the distortion of genuine information and content, imposter content is the impersonation of genuine sources. One of the most common fomrs of disinfromation is unintentional, especailly through the form of satire and parody, presenting humorous but false stories and infromation as though they are true.</p>

		<h3>Disinformation vs Misinformation</h3>
		<p>Misinformation is the spread of false information or news regardless of its intent. Misinformation is much more common and people experience everyday in our lives, whether it be people mishearing or misremembering information and details or telling someone something you heard on TV or socail media that isn't true. Misinformation spreads easuly due to technology and social media. Disinformation is similar to misonformaiton except it is when someone knowingly spreads misinformation with harmful intent. Disinformation is very powerful, destructive, and divisive, and is a common tool of espionage. Countries often have an interest in intentionally spreading fake information to their rival nations. </p>
